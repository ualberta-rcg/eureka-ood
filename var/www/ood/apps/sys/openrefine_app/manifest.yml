  Launch [OpenRefine] on the Eureka high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, powered by the [University of Alberta].

  OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; extending it with web services; and linking it to databases.

  Jobs are scheduled with [SLURM], and you can request CPU and memory resources for your OpenRefine environment.
